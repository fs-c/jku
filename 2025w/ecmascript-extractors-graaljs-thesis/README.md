abstract: 6-8 sentences. what problem is being solved. how is this done. what is the result: what works, how many tests, etc.; whe benefits.

intro: basically extended abstract. why is stage 1 being implemented (= just wanted rough POC). contributions: what did this work do? include code example from ch 3.

background: what is js/ecma (context, where used etc.). proposal process.

extractors: more elaborate example. move prior art to new chapter (related work). make all (most) listings floats.

testing -> evaluation: add interesting edge cases.

conclusion: what did we actually do. basically condensed intro again -> what is now possible. maybe future work.
