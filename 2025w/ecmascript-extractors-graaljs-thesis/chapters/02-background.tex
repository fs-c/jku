\chapter{Background}
\label{sec:background}

kitchen sink for everything that might be useful "background information" for other sections but isn't relevant in there:

\begin{itemize}
    \item background on this thesis being about implementing an ecmascript stage 1 proposal:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item outline the tc39 process https://tc39.es/process-document/
        \item given it's status as stage 1 it's in principle too early for engines to implement this, explain why we did it anyways here
    \end{itemize}
    \item background on graaljs/truffle framework
    \begin{itemize}
        \item graaljs: ECMAScript implementation built on Oracle GraalVM (what is GraalVM?)
        \item what is truffle framework
        \item (maybe mention history of proposal implementations on graaljs)
    \end{itemize}
    \item define ECMAScript "abstract operation" (relevant because a core part of the proposal is specified as an abstract operation)
    \begin{itemize}
        \item are effectively spec "helper functions" that abstract spec descriptions
        \item they aren't internal methods (those would be actual program logic)
        \item e.g., the abstract operation `Call(F, V, [, argumentsList])' eventually returns `F.[[Call]](V, argumentsList)' which is the actual call (F is the function, V the `this') but it also specifies some other behavior like that a TypeError has to be thrown if `IsCallable(F)' (another abstract operation) is false
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
