\chapter{Background}
\label{sec:background}

kitchen sink for everything that might be useful "background information" for other sections but isn't relevant in there:

 - background on this thesis being about implementing an ecmascript stage 2 proposal:
    - outline the tc39 process https://tc39.es/process-document/
    - maybe list some other active proposals (same stage, below, above) to give some context on what's currently happening
        - (maybe in particular pattern matching)
- background on graaljs/truffle framework
    - graaljs: ECMAScript implementation built on Oracle GraalVM (what is GraalVM?)
    - what is truffle framework
    - maybe mention history of proposal implementations on graaljs
- define ECMAScript "abstract operation" (relevant because a core part of the proposal is specified as an abstract operation)
    - are effectively spec "helper functions" that abstract spec descriptions
    - they aren't internal methods (those would be actual program logic)
    - e.g., the abstract operation `Call(F, V, [, argumentsList])' eventually returns `F.[[Call]](V, argumentsList)' which is the actual call (F is the function, V the `this') but it also specifies some other behavior like that a TypeError has to be thrown if `IsCallable(F)' (another abstract operation) is false
