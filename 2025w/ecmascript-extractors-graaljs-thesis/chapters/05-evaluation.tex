\chapter{Evaluation\label{sec:evaluation}}

\begin{itemize}
    \item want to test for completeness and correctness
    \item extended existing JSSimpleTestSuite
    \item include all code examples from README (but note that many of them are wrong, see \href{https://github.com/tc39/proposal-extractors/issues/32}) and a selection from proposal champion communications
    \item include test cases for all requirements outlined in \zcref{sec:extractors-core-specification-semantics}
    \item consider performance
    \begin{itemize}
        \item common use cases with vs.~without extractor syntax
        \item using extractors vs.~using the desugaring
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
