While ECMAScript includes functionality for array and object destructuring that mirrors construction of arrays and objects through literals, it lacks a mechanism to achieve symmetry between object construction and destructuring for more complex cases, e.g.~for classes with private members, or when transformation or validation before destructuring is desirable. The ECMAScript Extractors proposal addresses this by introducing a mechanism to execute user-defined logic during destructuring. This allows encapsulated transformation and validation of data in contexts where similar existing language functionality like array and object destructuring is not powerful enough.

No major runtime currently implements the Extractors proposal, which is in Stage 1. To remedy this, we implemented the proposal in GraalJS, a Java-based JavaScript engine built on top of GraalVM.\@ We extended the parser to recognize the new syntax, adjusted AST generation to emit a new node for the special Extractors semantics, and implemented the runtime behavior of this node. Given the proposal's early stage there is no official conformance suite; therefore, we developed a custom test suite based on functional requirements derived from the draft specification.

As a result of this work, users of GraalJS can benefit from the Extractors proposal and the feasibility of the proposal within a production engine has been demonstrated. It lays the foundation for future work in this regard, both in the context of GraalJS, where potential future iterations of the proposal can now be implemented more quickly, and in the ecosystem as a whole, which benefits from our test suite.
