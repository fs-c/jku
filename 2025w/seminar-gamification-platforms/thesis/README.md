`llncs.cls` is copied from the [`llncs`-package](https://ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/llncs?lang=en), modified to fix the table of contents. in the given template it only lists thesis title and author (since springer will use the command in their journal compilation process), but here we want an actual toc as in a default class.

`mylncs.bbx` is copied from the [`biblatex-lncs`](https://ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/biblatex-contrib/biblatex-lncs?lang=en), modified to add support for the `note` (and `doi`/`url`) field to all types. usually this is only supported for types like `misc` and `online`, but the deliverable required notes (summary, "valuation") on a number of references so they are also styled differently from the normal entry contents to set them apart.
