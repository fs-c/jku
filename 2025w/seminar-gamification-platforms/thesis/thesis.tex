\section{Literature Comments}

Literature reviews on gamification itself, i.e.\ not platforms/frameworks in particular:

\begin{itemize}
    \item\cite{Herz14} examines 37 studies to identify gamification requirements, but notes that much work has been done since then. In addition, the review was not the focus of the thesis. (Given)
    \item\cite{HaKS14} examine 24 (empirical, peer-reviewed) studies, creating a framework to examine the effectiveness of gamification.
\end{itemize}

Literature reviews on (theoretical) frameworks for gamification:

\begin{itemize}
    \item\cite{MRGA15} identify 10 \enquote{framework features} and judge 18 papers describing gamification frameworks or generic gamification process descriptions accordingly. Their individual reasoning is not always given, but the feature groups appear promising for adoption. (Given)
    \item\cite{MRGA17}, from the same authors as above, follows a similar methodology, but considers more papers and has a stronger focus on education as opposed to industry applications.
\end{itemize}

Framework descriptions:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Octalysis \cite{Chou15}
    \item 5W2H+M \cite{CoGS19}, although I couldn't really follow their description, and it doesn't appear to have gained any traction
    \item ...incomplete list, literature reviews contain many more
\end{itemize}
