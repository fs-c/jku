# Gamification: Evaluation of Platforms

The aim of this thesis is to provide a comparison/evaluation of gamification platforms/frameworks/engines, focusing primarily on open source systems but also on commercial ones (as far as appropriate info is available).

For this, a catalogue of evaluation criteria should be assembled top-down (by searching for already existing survey papers) and bottom-up (by collecting the features of existing systems), providing the basis for a homogenous comparison of the selected approaches.

Unique features or lacks of systems should be elaborated this way.
